# Four-Souls-Python-Version
A simpler version of the card game "Binding of Isaac: Four Souls", built in python, which can use user created ais, as well as supports 2-4 player, currently only on one machine.

Made with the intention of creating an AI that can then play the game.

If you want to create custom cards, I would recommend looking at the examples and templates that I have provided,
as they give a basic idea of how to create each card, and allows for these to be more modular without having to edit the source code.
Additionally, this is a very basic version of four souls, that among other things does not have online or graphics, so it probably is not a suitable replacement for the real version.
I would recommend purchasing the game, or playing the tabletop simulator version instead of this, as it is a pretty rough experience.
